4 Individual Machine Learning for Regression Model

Regression is one of the frequently used supervised machine learning models. The regression models predict the correct value of a given input data. Examples of regression problems are forecasting continuous outcomes like house prices, stock prices, or sales.

In this article, I will explain individual regression models, 4 models will be described in this article:
1. linear regression,
2. KNN,
3. decision tree, and
4. SVM

These four models will also be used to create a model that can predict the number of bike sharing based on certain factors.
